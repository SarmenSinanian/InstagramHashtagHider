# InstagramHashtagHider

Tired of people seeing the corny/targeted hashtags you use on your Instagram posts? I've got the solution for you! Go to https://instagramhashtaghider.herokuapp.com/ and list all the alpha-numeric words you'd like to use as hashtags, and my program will BURY them within tons of random words! Now, people won't know that you're using hashtags to farm for likes unless they're very scrupulous about your caption! (This is a work in progress; functionality is being improved and the website layout is also subject to improvement)
