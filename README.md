# InstagramHashtagHider (https://instagramhashtaghider.herokuapp.com/)

Tired of people seeing the corny/targeted hashtags you use on your Instagram posts? I've got the solution for you! Go to https://instagramhashtaghider.herokuapp.com/ and list all the alpha-numeric words you'd like to use as hashtags, and my program will BURY them within tons of random words that LOOK like hashtags ("pound"/"hashtag" symbol comes AFTER the generated word so it does not actually function; this leaves your TRUE hashtags to work their magic AND allows you to stay within the maximum capacity of 30 hashtags per Instagram post)! Now, people won't know that you're using hashtags to farm for likes unless they're very scrupulous about your caption! (This is a work in progress; functionality is being improved and the website layout is also subject to improvement)
